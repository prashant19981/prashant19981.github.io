                <p>This is a 3D game for which I created the Spinners 
                    model using Blender. In order to increase the performance of 
                    the game instead of using shaders I used a simple png image as 
                    the Spinner top surface. In this game, opponent Spinners are 
                    being controlled by the computer which follows 3 states 
                    (attack the main player, attack another player, and stay neutral) 
                    to make the game feel like a real match. To improve the performance of 
                    the game I reduced the vertex count of the Spinner models.</p>

                <img src="images/Shark.gif" class="image fit" alt="" />
                <p>This is a 2D-based game in which the sharks attack the main player's boat. The main feature of the game was to code the shark objects in a way that ensured that the main player was followed in a smooth manner. The shark animation was made using After Effects. To make the game more fun and exciting I worked on improving the spawning mechanism of rocks.</p>

                <img src="images/Arrdart.gif" class="image fit" alt="" />
                <p>This is one of the first games that I made. In this game, the user has to aim at the floating dart and try to hit the center of the dart. Points are given based on where the dart lands. In this game like all the other games, I successfully implemented AD based reward system and In-App Purchases.</p>

                <p>This is a 2D board game. It is a 4-player game. In this game, I tried to make the dice roll look as seamless as possible. This game also has a lot of 2D animation which I created using Unity Animation tool.</p>
